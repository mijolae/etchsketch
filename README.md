This is my Etch-A-Sketch project. It took a lot of inner motivation to start this one, because I've heard it's a little difficult. Focusing on utilizing DOM/Javascript today!

So it is April 28th and I have finished the Etch-A-Sketch. It required a lot of googling, because I took such a long break in between. After this project, I will be going over Event Listeners, as I was stuck for some time on that portion. Also, I'm looking to come back to this project eventually as this initial version is just bare bones. The design could be so *so* much better.
